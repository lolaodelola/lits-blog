I thought I knew what an array is, in fact, when I began learning to code it was one of the easier data structures for me to pick up. It's basically just a list of stuff with square brackets around it, `[1,2,3,4,5]`, and my writing background taught me all about lists and they're wonderful dynamicity. You can use them for anything in literature and in Ruby too, they're a wonderful multipurpose storage system; they can contain an infinite amount of stuff (lol) and can store different types of stuff (also lol). Then I began learning Java.
