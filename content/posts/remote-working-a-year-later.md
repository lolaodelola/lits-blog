  I've been remote working full-time for a year now, and here's what I've
  learnt.

If I have my way, I'll be working remotely for a very long time, if not the rest of my life. I'm done with the traditional office set up; the open plan nature of the office, having to be social all the time, and endless meetings.

That's not to say I don't see the benefits of being in the same space as your colleagues, but for me the cons outweigh the pros. However, there are some things I had to get used to which I thought I'd write about, and some questions I thought I'd answer.

I've worked remotely for the past year in two different roles:

1. **Product Engineer** (Buffer): This role was a typical software engineering role, building on the main product. A bit of context switching but all within the same ecosystem.

2. **Platform Support Engineer** (Heroku, current company): This is role is primarily a support role, where I answer customer tickets about the technical issues they have the platform, so essentially being a professional debugger. I've also taken on some coding projects as part of the role. A lot of context switching, especially as I'm helping debug apps in programming languages/frameworks I know nothing/very little about.

Both were on teams that were remote when I joined and already had systems in place for things like communication and work flows, however, the work for both and the culture of each team made one far easy to work within than the other.

Discipline
-
For a very long time, I thought I wasn't a very disciplined person. I found it hard to stick to routines and do stuff exactly when I should, I'm the person that won't wash up immediately after using something, but that doesn't mean I will never wash up, just not right now (to the annoyance of my mum). However, the issue isn't that I'm not disciplined, I can form and stick to new habits, the issue is that trying to fit myself into how someone else says I should spend my time is difficult for me. When I used to work in an office, the days I'd work from home were mostly more holistically productive for me, I could not only get the work I was paid to do, done, but I could also cook, rest when I needed, do laundry, etc

Space
-
Open plan offices are my idea of professional hell. Working in a space that makes me happy and is inviting to me, is so crucial in me being productive. This year, I've been to an office 4 times to work, and most of time I either left early or arrived after lunch time. One time I spent pretty much the whole day, but that was for a specific reason (I accidentally smashed my laptop screen). And my employers have invested money into allowing me to make my space comfortable for me. My ex-employers had a policy of: you can keep any office equipment we buy even after you leave (including laptop), so even though I was with them for less than 6 months, I was able to keep the laptop and desk they paid for. My current employers don't (seem to) have the same policy but I've still been able to get a very good office chair (the aeron) which they paid for, and I random bits & bobs (external keyboard, mouse, etc). Waking up and coming to this office feels good.

Work/Life
-
Work/life balance is important and a concern that many people have with remote working is that it's far easier to over-work than if you work from an office because of the clearer separation of concerns. I've only combated this in one way, which works for me. I have two laptops one for work and one for personal use, and I'm pretty strict with how I use both. What makes it easier is that my work laptop has so many security protocols installed on it that I can't possibly install any work things on my personal laptop even if I wanted to. But regardless of that, I don't install any personal things on my work laptop, I don't log into personal email/social accounts. The only personal things I use on my work laptop are Whatsapp for web & my personal-work (read: business) google account, the latter so that I can test things w/ my business Heroku account. This has been the single most useful thing for me because it means at 5pm I can literally just shut my laptop & that's it. I do have Slack on my personal phone but I switched off notifications for it, it's literally just so if I need to reach out to my manager/team & I don't have access to my laptop.
