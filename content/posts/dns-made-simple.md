DNS, for software engineers, is a big, clouded mystery. It's a plant that you have to interact with once a year but you don't really know _how_ to look after it so you kind of just wing it and hope for the best. It can get messy, complicated and overwhelming but it needn't be. Working in a tech support capacity, I see just how many engineers and non-tech ppl battle with their domain settings every week. From expired SSL certs to domains not showing what is expected in the browser, so I thought I'd give a shallow step into DNS and the bits you should really know to make changing your domain settings less painful.
